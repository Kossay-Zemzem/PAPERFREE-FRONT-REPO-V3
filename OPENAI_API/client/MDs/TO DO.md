- [ ] Logout button gradient doen't work with animations (and smooting them)
### High priority  [UNFINISHED]

- [ ]

- [ ] 
### Low priority  [UNFINISHED]
- [ ] 
### Implementing Figma concept
- [x] Add logout icon/text to all pages
- [ ] Better style the uploaded image preview
- [ ] add title / explanatory icon to each page (CIN , PASSEPORT  , etc....)
- [ ] Implement **login/sign** up page before 
	- [ ] increase size of boxes

### Functional changes
- [ ] -Figure out why the bottom footer doesn't reach the very end of the page
